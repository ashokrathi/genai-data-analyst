To-DO Tasks
===========
1. (Nice-to-have) Send dimension data for better understanding of the prompt

2. (Very-Nice-to-have) If no "Dimension" exists, should we query "Facts" to generate additional context?

    unique(DF.colname)

X 3. (Important) Human Feedback, and store the response in Pinecone DB

4. (Nice-to-have) Is this the correct dataset for the user prompt?
    - Prep: one time:
        - Send data to LLM, and ask for 20 different related notes and prompts user can potenitally ask
        - Put these notes into VectorDB with the DataSet tag
    - When user fires up a query, and there is very low semantic score matching the currently selected dataset:
            - prompt user to check the dataset
            - Also ask them if they want to continue

X 5. (Nice-to-have) Show user prompt in the Results

6. (Useful) Show metadata info - Table names, column names.

7. (Nice-to-have) Convert Data config into YAML format.



Prompt enhancements:

- For pie charts, only use positive values.
    (Fixes for negative values for the Pie chart)
- Upon inference, exclude <sample_data> section in the response.
    (Fixes some XML issues)
