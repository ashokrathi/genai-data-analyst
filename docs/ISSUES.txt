1. XML and Special Characters - such as &
    When LLM returns XML response, the embedded code has '&' for 'and' condition for Dataframes. This causes XML parser to fail.
    XML parser needs to see this as &amp;.
    Example: us_companies = revenueDF[(revenueDF['country'] == 'United States') & (revenueDF['revenue_ttm'] > 100000000000)]

    Solution: Write code to replace XML special char right after the response, and restored it back after code extraction
        & --> (##XXREPLACE_ANDXX##)

Prompt:
show pie chart of 'United States' companies that have revenue of more than 100000000000. During inference, do the following:
 Remove entire section of code contained in <sample_data>, and change '&' occurrence to '&amp;'

2. Had issue with malformed XML in <sample_data> section. Add to the prompt to remove that section during inference. 

3. (Error) When User Prompt has line-break, st.header() fails in the generated Python code.
Solution: Make sure User prompt is created as one line. That means we need to combine multiple lines into one.
